A while back I noticed that one of the plastic clips that holds the air-filter box closed in my Fiat Panda 141 had a broken corner and would come off when opened. It was still doing its job when closed, as it was being kept in place by the pressure of the closed peg, so at first I didn't bother to replace it.

Now that I had some free time though, I designed a replacement that can be 3D-printed and save a couple of euros; I also took the chance to try designing a second model with a lightly stiffened structure. On the left, the almost-original design, on the right, the stiffened one:

If you want to design your own, here are all the relevant measures:
