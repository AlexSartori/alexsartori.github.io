This time I took advantage of the break between two exams to make a little jump in my past. My father is a goldsmith, and when I was a kid I used to always wander around his workshop craving to learn everything he was doing. I only ever worked on brass however, but that was obviously enough to have my dose of fun.

One manufacturing technique I always somewhat overlooked is embossment (probably because of its difficulty) so this time I took the chance to try and give it a serious shot. I had this idea for a tiny watering can for some tiny fat plants my dad has in his office and I started sketching a couple of ideas. The first step was to emboss two rings to act as the container body and two “waves” to be soldered together as a spout.

After a lot of tough refining, cutting, and soldering, this was the result:

At this point, it only missed a base, some legs, and a complete assembly:

A bit of polishing, and done! Overall it took roughly a week, and let me tell you I did not expect this technique to be this hard. But man is it satisfying :smile:
