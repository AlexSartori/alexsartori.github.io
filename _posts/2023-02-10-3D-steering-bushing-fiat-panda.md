Here's a replica of the Fiat Panda 141 bushing that holds the steering arm on the passenger-side of the steering rack. The original one broke to pieces after 30 years of honored service, but to replace it I would've had to umount everything from the wheel to the rack itself, pull it out, and open up the pinion box. Instead, I decided to try and print the bushing in TPU, so that I could cut open one side and wrap it around the arm before sliding it inside the rack.

I'm still unsure if the material is stiff enough, but after some ~1000 km I can say that it still performs very well and I feel no vibrations or noises as before.

If you need it, you can download the STL file from here:
