I had some nice, longh-ish, springs around. I thought I could build a small dynamometer, especially because it's been some time since I've wanted to calibrate my torque wrench but I had no way of doing so. Therefore, in the next posts you'll probably see me checking if my torque wrench is precise enough, using this handmade dynamometer.

## Steps

First things first, I grabbed a wooden slab and a bolt to attach the spring at the top.

Next, I cut a shape from a piece of brass that I could bolt to the other end of the spring. This piece will point at the notches on the wood that I'll mark at each kilogram of weight:

I only had two weights of 1 kg and one of 2 kg around, so I marked the first four weights by hand, and interpolated the rest. From the chart you can probably see that the spring is far from ideal, as it does not have a constant factor (the weights I used were intead very precise).

As a finishing touch, I used the pyrograph to mark all the notches. I left the interpolated ones without the number to remind myself that those are not real measures but interpolated ones.
