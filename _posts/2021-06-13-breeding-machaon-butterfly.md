## Premise
Last year, I happened to find a huge dark caterpillar on the driveway, which turned out to be a [*Convolvulus Hawk-Moth*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agrius_convolvuli). Eager to witness the metamorphosis, I built a small cabinet in which it could peacefully live its life while a webcam monitored everything.

Unfortunately, despite being kept inside the house during winter, the chrysalis did not survive. At that point, to relieve my mild sadness, I had been gifted with a wonderful "kit". Apparently, there's this website where they sell kits for growing different species of interesting caterpillars, in my case *Papilio Machaons*, among the most beautiful butterflies of Europe.

## The Machaons
Out of the many beautiful pictures and videos I shot, I decided to only post a (rather silly) montage of them:

What can I say... Beauty certainly lies in the details. :butterfly:
