Ready for yet another useless invention? Then behold: I present to you the **micro-micro-scope**!

## What In...
I know, the name sounds silly, but I believe it actually is one pretty fun object to keep in your pocket during a hike. Also mind that it basically is a toy version of a cheap microscope, so lower your expectations to zero.

What I did was buying a toy microscope at a thrift store (those for kids, it cost â‚¬6), tearing it down, and saving the lenses.

What I had in mind was really an extreme strip-down of every unessential bit, leaving just an ocular, a body, and an objective. After a couple of measurements, I modeled a body that could be screwed in itself (lipstick-like, so to speak) to save even more space, hoping that just by holding it in one hand would be easy enough to properly focus a glass slide held in the other hand, ideally facing the sky to light the sample.

## First Results
Unfortunately, and almost obviously I'd now say, no such steady hand exits to hold a microscope in focus and on the same spot. Therefore, a couple of sketches later I printed a small support that could be slid forward and backward by rotating a knob and could act as a stop when placing the scope against an object. The print ended up with a horrible finish (probably because of the heat and humidity of that afternoon), but after some filing the result was like this:

At this point, I even managed to snap some pictures! As you can see below (random debris in a drop of water), the focus is still far from precise and no clear details can be seen, but getting a stable enough image for taking a photo I think was already a pretty good result.

## Current Results
I think the micro-micro-scope reached a "usable" and possibly final state when I reprinted part of the focusing assembly (to correct screw tolerances and improve the finish) and modeled a support to hold it against my phone camera:

Finally, at this stage, I managed to get a couple of quite interesting snaps. The first one shows just enough detail to reveal the cells of a leaf, while in the second one I spotted a paramecium (most likely) swimming around:
